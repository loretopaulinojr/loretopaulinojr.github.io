Hi, I'm **Loreto Paulino Jr.**, a researcher exploring the intricate connections between microbial networks and ocean biogeochemistry. 

I have a background in **chemistry and mathematics**, and my research integrates computational modeling, microbial ecology, and experimental approaches to study oceanic microbial communities. One of my current work focuses on understanding how marine heterotrophic bacteria produce dissolved organic matter, utilizing a probabilistic method to estimate for a producibility metric.

## What to Expect from This Blog  

I created this blog  on February 5, 2025. I will make this blog a space where I share insights into my research journey, scientific discoveries, and the challenges and breakthroughs that come with studying microbial metabolism. Here, you’ll find:  

- **Deep dives into marine microbiology** – discussions on microbial interactions, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and biogeochemical cycling.  
- **Computational approaches in microbiome research** – thoughts on network analysis, flux balance modeling, and data-driven insights.  
- **Graduate school & academia** – reflections on applying to PhD programs, scientific writing, and navigating research as an underrepresented scientist.  
- **Personal experiences & outreach** – my journey as a Pacific Islander in STEM and efforts to make science more inclusive and accessible.

My research journey has taken me from **Guam to Boston, Bermuda, Alaska, and Rhode Island**, through various fellowships and fieldwork experiences. I have worked on marine microbial metabolism, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) accumulation, coral resilience modeling, and oceanographic field research.
